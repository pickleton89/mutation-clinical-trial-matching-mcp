- **QueryTrialsNode**: Unified node with mode detection for API requests
- **SummarizeTrialsNode**: Unified LLM-powered summarization with retry logic
- **BatchQueryTrialsNode**: Batch processing with concurrency control (async) or sequential processing (sync)
- **Auto-Detection**: Nodes automatically determine execution mode at runtime

### Unified Foundation Layer

- **Unified HTTP Client** (`utils/http_client.py`): Single HTTP client supporting both sync and async with connection pooling
- **Unified Node Framework** (`utils/unified_node.py`): Base classes with automatic mode detection
- **Shared Utilities** (`utils/shared.py`): Common validation, error handling, and metrics functions
- **Cache Strategies** (`utils/cache_strategies.py`): Smart cache warming and invalidation (async mode)
- **Configuration System** (`servers/config.py`): Centralized configuration with environment overrides
- **Legacy Compatibility** (`servers/legacy_compat.py`): Backward compatibility layer with migration guidance

## Unified Node Pattern Implementation

This project implements the **enhanced PocketFlow Node pattern** with unified sync/async execution, providing a modular, maintainable approach to building AI workflows:

### Unified Core Node Classes (`utils/unified_node.py`)

- **UnifiedNode**: Base class supporting both sync and async execution with automatic mode detection
- **UnifiedBatchNode**: Extension for batch processing with concurrency control (async) or sequential processing (sync)
- **UnifiedFlow**: Orchestrates execution with intelligent mode selection

### Unified Implementation Nodes (`clinicaltrials/unified_nodes.py`)

1. **QueryTrialsNode** (Unified):
   ```python
   # Single implementation supporting both modes
   def prep(self, shared): return shared["mutation"]
   
   def exec(self, mutation): 
       return self.trials_service.query_trials(mutation)  # Sync version
   
   async def aexec(self, mutation): 
       return await self.trials_service.aquery_trials(mutation)  # Async version
   
   def post(self, shared, mutation, result):
       shared["trials_data"] = result
       shared["studies"] = result.get("studies", [])
       return self.get_next_node_id(result)
   ```

2. **SummarizeTrialsNode** (Unified):
   ```python
   # Unified summarization with mode detection
   def prep(self, shared): return shared["studies"]
   
   def exec(self, studies): 
       return self.llm_service.call_llm(prompt)  # Sync version
   
   async def aexec(self, studies): 
       return await self.llm_service.acall_llm(prompt)  # Async version
   
   def post(self, shared, studies, summary):
       shared["summary"] = summary
       return None  # End of flow
   ```

### Unified Flow Execution

The unified MCP server creates and runs flows with automatic mode detection:

```python
# Create unified nodes (mode determined at runtime)
query_node = QueryTrialsNode(async_mode=server.async_mode)
summarize_node = SummarizeTrialsNode(async_mode=server.async_mode)

# Use PocketFlow chaining syntax
query_node >> summarize_node

# Create unified flow
flow = UnifiedFlow(start_node=query_node, async_mode=server.async_mode)

# Run flow with shared context (automatically sync or async)
shared = {"mutation": mutation}
if server.async_mode:
    result = await flow.aexecute(shared)
else:
    result = flow.execute(shared)
```

### Key Advantages of Unified Pattern

✅ **Single Implementation**: One codebase supports both sync and async execution  
✅ **Auto-Detection**: Nodes automatically determine optimal execution mode  
✅ **Runtime Selection**: Mode can be selected at server startup or runtime  
✅ **Preserved Interface**: Same `prep`, `exec`, `post` pattern maintained  
✅ **Performance Optimization**: Mode-specific optimizations (timeouts, concurrency, batch limits)  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy node patterns continue working with deprecation warnings  

This unified pattern eliminates code duplication while preserving the modular, testable nature of the original PocketFlow design. For more details, see the [design document](docs/design.md).

## Usage

1. Install dependencies with uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop to use the **unified server**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mutation-clinical-trials-mcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "python", "servers/main.py"],
         "description": "Unified clinical trials matching server with runtime mode selection"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Optional**: Configure execution mode via environment variables:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mutation-clinical-trials-mcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "python", "servers/main.py"],
         "env": {
           "MCP_ASYNC_MODE": "true"
         },
         "description": "Unified server in explicit async mode"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Start Claude Desktop and ask questions like:
   - "What clinical trials are available for EGFR L858R mutations?"
   - "Are there any trials for BRAF V600E mutations?"  
   - "Tell me about trials for ALK rearrangements"
   - "Search for multiple mutations: EGFR L858R,BRAF V600E,KRAS G12C"

4. Use enterprise monitoring tools:
   - "Get the server health status"
   - "Show me the cache performance report"
   - "What are the current metrics?"

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following key dependencies:

- **Python 3.13+** - Base runtime environment
- **FastMCP** (`fastmcp>=2.10.2`) - High-performance async MCP framework
- **PocketFlow** (`pocketflow>=0.0.1`) - Framework for building modular AI workflows with the Node pattern  
- **Requests** (`requests==2.31.0`) - HTTP library for clinicaltrials.gov API calls (dev dependency for legacy test compatibility)
- **HTTPX** (`httpx>=0.28.1`) - Async HTTP client for direct Anthropic API calls
- **Redis** (`redis>=6.2.0`) - Optional distributed caching backend
- **Python-dotenv** (`python-dotenv==1.1.0`) - Environment variable management

**Enterprise Features:**
- Prometheus metrics collection and monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Distributed caching with Redis backend
- Cache warming strategies for performance optimization

All dependencies can be installed using `uv sync` as described in the installation instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If Claude Desktop disconnects from the MCP server:
- Check logs at: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mutation-clinical-trials-mcp.log`
- Restart Claude Desktop  
- Verify the server is running correctly with `uv run python servers/main.py`
- Check for deprecation warnings if using legacy servers (`servers/primary.py` or `servers/legacy/sync_server.py`)

**Redis Connection Warnings:**
- Redis connection errors are expected if Redis is not installed - the server uses in-memory caching as fallback
- To eliminate warnings: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`
- The server works perfectly without Redis, just with reduced caching performance

**Cache Warming on Startup:**
- Server automatically queries 15 common mutations on startup for performance optimization
- This is normal behavior and improves response times for frequent queries
- To disable: comment out `asyncio.run(startup_tasks())` in `servers/primary.py`
