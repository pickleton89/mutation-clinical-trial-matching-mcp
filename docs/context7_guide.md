## Using Context7 MCP with Pocket Flow

### Natural Language Prompting

While you can use formal function calls (described below), the easiest way to use Context7 MCP is through natural language prompts. This approach is more intuitive and aligns with the Agentic Coding principles where humans design and agents code.

#### Example Natural Language Prompts

##### 1. Resolving Library ID

Instead of formal function calls, you can simply ask:

```
Can you use the context7 MCP server to find the library ID for the Pocket Flow repository?
```

##### 2. Retrieving Documentation

Once you have the library ID, you can ask for specific guidance:

```
Can you retrieve documentation about the Node pattern from the Pocket Flow repository using Context7 MCP?
```

```
Please use Context7 to get information about project structure from the Pocket Flow framework.
```

##### 3. Implementing a Specific Pattern

You can ask for guidance on implementing specific patterns:

```
How should I implement the BatchNode pattern according to Pocket Flow guidelines? Can you use Context7 to show me examples?
```

##### 4. Getting Started

For initial project setup:

```
I'm starting a new project using Pocket Flow. Can you use Context7 to guide me through the initial setup and project structure?
```

#### Workflow with Natural Language

1. **Ask for guidance**: "I need to implement a clinical trial matching service using Pocket Flow. Can you use Context7 to provide guidance?"

2. **Refine your request**: "Can you specifically show me how to implement the Node pattern for querying an external API?"

3. **Apply the guidance**: Use the examples and patterns provided in your implementation

4. **Seek clarification**: "I'm having trouble with the flow orchestration. Can you explain how nodes should connect in Pocket Flow?"

5. **Iterate**: Continue refining your implementation based on the guidance

This natural language approach makes the interaction more conversational while still leveraging the power of Context7 MCP to access Pocket Flow documentation and guidance.

### Using Explicit Function Calls

If you prefer a more structured approach, you can use explicit function calls as described below.

#### Step 1: Resolve the Library ID

Before retrieving documentation, you need to resolve the Pocket Flow library ID using the `resolve-library-id` function:

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName: "the-pocket/pocketflow")
```

This will return available Context7-compatible library IDs, such as:
- `/the-pocket/pocketflow`
- `/the-pocket/pocketflow-tutorial-codebase-knowledge`
- `/the-pocket-world/pocket-flow-framework`

#### Step 2: Retrieve Documentation

Once you have the library ID, use the `get-library-docs` function to retrieve documentation:

```
get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/the-pocket/pocketflow",
  tokens: 5000,
  topic: "project structure"
)
```

Parameters:
- `context7CompatibleLibraryID`: The exact library ID from step 1
- `tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to retrieve (default: 5000)
- `topic`: Optional topic to focus on (e.g., "getting started", "project structure", "node pattern")

#### Step 3: Apply the Guidance

Use the retrieved documentation to guide your implementation. The documentation typically includes:
- Code examples
- Project structure recommendations
- Implementation patterns
- Best practices

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Understanding Project Structure

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName: "the-pocket/pocketflow")
get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/the-pocket/pocketflow",
  topic: "project structure"
)
```

This will provide guidance on how to structure your Pocket Flow project, including directory organization and file naming conventions.

### Scenario 2: Implementing Node Pattern

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName: "the-pocket/pocketflow")
get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/the-pocket/pocketflow",
  topic: "node pattern"
)
```

This will provide examples and guidance on implementing the Node pattern with `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods.

### Scenario 3: Flow Orchestration

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName: "the-pocket/pocketflow")
get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/the-pocket/pocketflow",
  topic: "flow orchestration"
)
```

This will provide guidance on how to create and orchestrate flows in Pocket Flow.

## Key Topics to Explore

When using Context7 MCP with Pocket Flow, consider exploring these topics:

1. **Getting Started**: Basic setup and initialization
2. **Project Structure**: Directory organization and file naming
3. **Node Pattern**: Implementation of `prep`, `exec`, and `post` methods
4. **Flow Orchestration**: Creating and running flows
5. **Batch Processing**: Using BatchNode for parallel processing
6. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling
7. **Testing**: Writing tests for nodes and flows

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: When requesting documentation, use specific topics rather than general queries
2. **Limit Token Count**: Start with a reasonable token count (3000-5000) and increase if needed
3. **Iterate**: If you don't get the information you need, try refining your topic
4. **Combine Sources**: Use documentation from multiple related libraries when needed

## Example Implementation Workflow

1. **Research**: Use Context7 MCP to retrieve Pocket Flow documentation on your task
2. **Design**: Apply the Agentic Coding principles to design your solution
3. **Implement**: Follow the Pocket Flow patterns in your implementation
4. **Test**: Verify your implementation against the patterns
5. **Refine**: Iterate based on additional guidance as needed

## Creating Memories from Pocket Flow Documentation

One powerful way to enhance your development workflow is to save important Pocket Flow patterns and guidelines as memories in your Windsurf environment. This allows you to maintain consistent access to key principles without repeatedly querying the Context7 MCP server.

### Benefits of Creating Memories

1. **Persistent Access**: Memories persist across sessions, providing continuous access to important guidelines
2. **Project-Specific Context**: Memories can be tailored to your specific project needs
3. **Reduced Latency**: Accessing memories is faster than making new Context7 MCP requests
4. **Consistent Reference**: Ensures all team members work from the same set of guidelines

### What to Memorize

Consider creating memories for:

1. **Core Patterns**: The Node pattern, Flow orchestration, and BatchNode implementation
2. **Project Structure**: Directory organization and file naming conventions
3. **Best Practices**: Error handling, testing approaches, and optimization techniques
4. **Implementation Examples**: Specific code examples relevant to your project

### Example Memory Creation

After retrieving documentation using Context7 MCP, you can ask to create a memory:

```
Can you create a memory with this Pocket Flow Node pattern implementation for our project?
```

Or more specifically:

```
Please save the BatchNode implementation pattern from Pocket Flow as a memory for our project.
```

### Accessing Memories

Once created, you can reference these memories during development:

```
Can you remind me of our Pocket Flow Node pattern implementation guidelines?
```

### Updating Memories

As you refine your understanding or when Pocket Flow updates, you can update memories:

```
Please update our Pocket Flow implementation memory with this new information about error handling.
```

By combining Context7 MCP for accessing up-to-date documentation with memories for persistent storage of key guidelines, you create a powerful development environment that supports the Agentic Coding principles.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Context7 MCP:

1. **Check Library ID**: Ensure you're using the correct Context7-compatible library ID
2. **Refine Topic**: Try more specific or different topics
3. **Increase Token Count**: If you're getting truncated responses, increase the token count
4. **Try Alternative Libraries**: Some content may be available in related libraries

## Conclusion

The Context7 MCP server provides a powerful way to access Pocket Flow documentation and guidance during development. By following this guide, you can leverage this capability to ensure your implementation follows the recommended patterns and best practices of the Pocket Flow framework.
